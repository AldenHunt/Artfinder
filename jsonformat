Graves carved an African board game, mancala, into a tabletop that spanned two legs, which were submerged in a salt solution; only one leg was treated with a protective coating. The original limestone legs wicked the water and salt thoroughly, efflorescing visibly in the uncoated areas. The game kept people seated at the site, allowing the process of entropy to be more fully considered. Both legs have been replaced for this installation, reversing the original concept of engineered destruction.",
